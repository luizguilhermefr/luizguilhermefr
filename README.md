### Hi there 👋

I am a software engineer working at 🚛 [Loadsmart](https://loadsmart.com), primarily with 🐍 Python (Django) and ⚛ JavaScript (React), but I like to work with 🐘 PHP (Laravel) too. I have a lot of hobbies, and I like to write about them. You can find some blog posts I wrote at my [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/u/luizguilhermefr).
